# Gender Gap Analysis in Bangladesh: A Multi-Sectoral Review (1980‚Äì2023)

This project explores gender-based disparities in Bangladesh across several key indicators using publicly available data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).  
The goal is to visualize and interpret long-term trends in education, employment, life expectancy, and maternal health to understand how gender dynamics have shifted over time.

## üìä Sections Analyzed

### 1. Education Enrollment Trends
- **Key Findings**: Female enrollment in secondary education now surpasses males, though literacy and tertiary education still show a male advantage.
- **Significance**: Shows real progress in female access to schooling but highlights persistent inequalities in higher education.

### 2. Education Completion Rates
- **Key Findings**: Girls have outpaced boys in lower secondary completion, while primary and tertiary levels show a smaller or male-dominated gap.
- **Significance**: Completion trends mirror access but also highlight drop-offs in higher education for women.

### 3. Labor Force Participation & Employment
- **Key Findings**: Men consistently lead in both labor force participation and employment rates. However, women's involvement is rising steadily.
- **Significance**: Gender gaps remain large, but changes suggest evolving economic roles for women.

### 4. Life Expectancy Trends
- **Key Findings**: Women consistently live longer than men. Both genders have seen rising life expectancy since the 1960s.
- **Significance**: Reflects health improvements and a persistent biological or behavioral gender gap.

### 5. Maternal Mortality Ratio
- **Key Findings**: Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births fell dramatically from over 900 in the late 1980s to below 200 by 2020.
- **Significance**: A major success story in women's health, though minor recent fluctuations may need investigation.
